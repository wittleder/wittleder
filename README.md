- 👋 Hi, I’m @wittleder. I am currently a freshman at university studying mathematics and computer science.
- 👀 I’m interested in building tools that lead to positive and productive interactions between people (like GitHub now that I mention it), music, design (architecture, fashion, 3d modeling), and math.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML, Pytorch, and Django.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything if it captures my interest. 
- 📫 How to reach me: wittlederme@gmail.com
